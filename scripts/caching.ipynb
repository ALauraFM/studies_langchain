      "First response: (API call made):    World War One, also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918.

The war was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in June 1914, which led to a chain of events that eventually resulted in the outbreak of war. The conflict was primarily fought in Europe, but also saw battles and campaigns in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.  The war was characterized by trench warfare, in which soldiers dug complex systems of trenches to protect themselves from enemy fire. This led to a stalemate on the Western Front, with neither side able to make significant advances for several years.  The war saw the use of new and advanced technologies, such as machine guns, chemical weapons, and tanks. It also saw the first large-scale use of airplanes in combat.
